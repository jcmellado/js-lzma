#summary Basic usage of the library.

= How to use? =

Just call to the `decompress` function.

{{{
LZMA.decompress(properties, inStream, outStream, outSize);
}}}

Where:
 * `properties` is the input data stream with LZMA properties
 * `inStream` is the input data stream to decompress
 * `outStream` is the output data stream
 * `outSize` is the expected size of output data stream

= Streams =

Input data streams must be JavaScript objects exposing a public `readByte` function:

{{{
var inStream = {
  data: [ /* Put your compressed data here */ ],
  offset: 0,
  readByte: function(){
    return this.data[this.offset ++];
  }
};
}}}

Output data streams must be JavaScript objects exposing a public `writeByte` function:

{{{
var outStream = {
  data: [ /* Uncompressed data will be putted here */ ],
  offset: 0,
  writeByte: function(value){
    this.data[this.offset ++] = value;
  }
};
}}}

Ok, you can mix both on a more generic one. And change `Array` to `String`, some sort of `Typed Array`, or whatever you want.

= Properties =

LZMA properties are described on <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html">LZMA SDK</a>.

Just five bytes. The first one containing `lc`, `lp` and `pb` parameters, and the last four the dictionary size (little endian encoding).

= Limitations =

Output size is limited to 32 bits.

= What about compression function? =

Sorry, don't. This library is part of another project of mine that only needed the decompression algorithm.
